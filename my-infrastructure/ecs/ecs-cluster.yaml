# This CloudFormation template creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster with the name "my-cluster" and exports 
# the cluster name as an output value named "ECSClusterName".
# The ECSCluster resource is defined using the AWS::ECS::Cluster type, 
# and it has a single property called ClusterName which is set to "my-cluster".
# This output value can be imported and used by other CloudFormation stacks or templates.

# This YAML file defines a CloudFormation stack that creates an Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) cluster with the name specified in the cluster_name environment variable.

# The ECSCluster resource is defined using the AWS::ECS::Cluster type, and its properties include a ClusterName that is set to the value of the cluster_name environment variable.

# Finally, the stack exports the name of the ECS cluster using the Outputs section. The ECSClusterName output value is set to the reference of the ECSCluster resource, and is exported
# with the name ECSClusterName so it can be imported and used by other CloudFormation stacks or templates.
