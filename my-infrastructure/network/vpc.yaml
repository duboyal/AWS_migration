# NOTE !!! 

# in order to use AWS DataSync to transfer data from your local computer to the S3 bucket within your VPC, 
# you will need to allow inbound traffic to your VPC from your local computer's IP address.

# You can do this by creating a security group rule that allows inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH) from your local IP address. 
# This will allow you to establish an SSH connection to your instances within your VPC, which is required for AWS DataSync to transfer data to your S3 bucket.

#-----CidrBlock------
# Classless Inter-Domain Routing, which is a method for allocating IP addresses and routing Internet Protocol packets. 
# It's a set of IP address standards that are used to create unique identifiers for networks and individual devices on those networks.

# In this specific YAML code block, CidrBlock is the property that defines the IP address range of the
# VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) being created. The value "10.0.0.0/16" indicates that the VPC will have an 
# IP address range of 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255, with 16 bits being used for the network portion and 
# 16 bits being used for the host portion.
